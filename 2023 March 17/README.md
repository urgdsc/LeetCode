# 2023 March 17 session with [Yazdan Ranjbar](https://github.com/yazdanra)

Thank you so much for participating in today's session. We only get to solve the very first question today ([205. Isomorphic Strings](/2023 March 2017/205. Isomorphic Strings))

I will add the solutions for the two remaining questions and hopefully we'll cover them in future events! Stay tuned!
